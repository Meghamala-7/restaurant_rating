# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction App (XGBoost + Streamlit)

This **Restaurant Rating Prediction App** uses machine learning to predict a restaurant's **aggregate rating** (on a scale of 1 to 5) based on features like location, cuisine, cost, delivery options, and more. Powered by **XGBoost** and deployed with an interactive **Streamlit** interface, it allows users to experiment with different inputs to see how they affect the predicted rating. This is my first task in Cognifyz Technologies as a machine learning Intern.

# 🚀 Features
